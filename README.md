## ecu-dev
This project aims to develop a software framework for a general-purpose Electronic Control Unit using FreeRTOS.

Users should have access to a simple C/C++ API to perform common tasks in a robotics/electronics application, such as running functions on a timer, reading analogue/digital signals, SPI, UART and CAN messaging, TCP/UDP networking, logging, etc.
This is ultimately designed to be deployed on a Colibri iMX7 embedded computer, but is still currently a work in progress.
